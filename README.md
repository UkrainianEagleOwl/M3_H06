# Clustering Analysis of 2D Data and MNIST Dataset

## Project Overview

This project applies K-means clustering to both a simple 2D dataset and the more complex MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. For the MNIST dataset, PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is utilized to reduce the dimensionality to two principal components before clustering.

## Features

- Implementation of K-means clustering algorithm.
- Use of the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA for the MNIST dataset.
- Data visualization for both the 2D and PCA-reduced MNIST datasets.

## How to Run

Ensure that you have Python installed on your system, along with the following packages:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UkrainianEagleOw/M2_H06.git
cd M2_H06
```

Run Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab, and open the `.ipynb` file:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Follow the instructions within the notebook to run the analyses.

## Results

The analysis includes an elbow plot to determine the optimal number of clusters and scatter plots to visualize the results of the K-means clustering.
